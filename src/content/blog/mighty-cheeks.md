  An ode to my daughter's adorable cheeks.
---

Mighty cheeks that gulp and suck,
mother's milk and grippy hands.

Mighty cheeks that makes one weak,
disarmed to comply.

Mighty cheeks many has deceived,
some into sleepless nights,
others to conceive more mighty cheeks.

Mighty cheeks will disappear,
but someday, produce its own.
