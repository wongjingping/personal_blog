While this blog is named after myself, I hope that it has less crass self-promotion, and more things of relevance and value to the reader; original thoughts (no AI generated content),what I've learned, am hypothesizing, and hoping for. The following statements about myself are really my way of holding this blog accountable to a set of principles that I hope to live by in my real life.

My life is a gift I did not earn, and I'm grateful for it. My upbringing, the quality of education I received, and the opportunities I was given, are all gifts that someone worked hard to afford me. I've made my share of mistakes, and I'm grateful for 2nd chances. I don't deserve someone making up for my missing the mark, but Jesus Christ thought I was worth it.

As such, I hope that amidst the critique, value judgments, and "best guesses", that my words will always be buoyed by an undercurrent of gratitude, humility, and grace towards all.
